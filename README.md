Errata is a combination of plugin and software client to manage Rails application errors.

The Errata plugin logs all errors from your application (along with their context of the error) into JSON files that are served from your applications public directory. You specify how many errors to keep and the plugin automatically manages deleting old error files.

The Errata plugin goes hand-in-hand with the Errata client that reads the errors and presents them in a friendly fashion.
